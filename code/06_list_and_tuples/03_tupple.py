# Tuples
Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable (cannot be changed). They are defined using parentheses ().

# Creating a tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, "a", "b", "c")
print("Tuple:", my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c')

# Accessing elements
print("First element:", my_tuple[0])  # Output: 1
print("Last element:", my_tuple[-1])  # Output: 'c'

# Slicing
print("Slice from index 1 to 4:", my_tuple[1:4])  # Output: (2, 3, 'a')

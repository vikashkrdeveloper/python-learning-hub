# Introduction to Strings
Strings are sequences of characters used to store and manipulate text in Python. In python, string is immutable, meaning once created, their content cannot be changed.
# Strings can be defined using single quotes (' '), double quotes (" "), or triple quotes (""" ''' or """ """).


# Examples of defining strings:
single_quote_str = 'Hello, World!'
double_quote_str = "Hello, World!"
triple_quote_str = """Hello, World!"""\"
triple_single_quote_str = \'''Hello, World!'''

name = "Vikash"  # String variable

print(name)  # Output: Vikash
print(type(name))  # Output: <class 'str'>
print(len(name))  # Output: 6 (length of the string)

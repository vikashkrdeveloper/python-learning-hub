# What is System Input in Python?
System input in Python refers to the process of receiving data or commands from the user or an external source while a Python program is running. This is typically done using built-in functions that allow the program to read input from the keyboard, files, or other input devices. The most common way to get user input in Python is through the `input()` function, which reads a line of text entered by the user and returns it as a string.

# Example of using `input()` function:
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Special Operators in Python
Special operators are a set of operators that perform specific operations on values. They include:
- `lambda`  : Create anonymous functions
- `yield`   : Return a generator from a function
- `await`   : Pause coroutine execution until awaited task completes
- `del`     : Delete a variable or object
- `:`       : Specify a range (slicing)
- `...`     : Ellipsis, used in advanced slicing and type hinting
- `@`       : Decorators and matrix multiplication
- `:=`      : Walrus operator (assignment expression)
- `,`       : Separate items in lists, tuples, and arguments
- `.`       : Access attributes and methods of objects
- `()`      : Group expressions and call functions
- `[]`      : Define lists and access elements by index
- `{}`      : Define dictionaries and sets

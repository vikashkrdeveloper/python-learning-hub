# Python - String Concatenation

String concatenation is the process of combining two or more strings into one.

## How to Concatenate Strings

You can use the `+` operator to concatenate strings in Python.

### Example

Merge variable `a` with variable `b` into variable `c`:

```python
a = "Hello ==> "
b = "World"
c = a + b
print(c)  # Output: Hello ==> World
```

### Adding a Space Between Strings

To add a space between the strings, include `" "` in the concatenation:

```python
a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + " " + b
print(c)  # Output: Hello World
```

## Exercise

What is the correct syntax to merge variable `x` and `y` into variable `z`?

- [ ] `z = x, y`
- [ ] `z = x = y`
- [ ] `z = x + y`
- [ ] `z = x - y`
  > The correct answer is `z = x + y`. The `+` operator is used for string concatenation in Python.

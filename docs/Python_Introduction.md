# Python Introduction

## What is Python?

Python is a popular programming language created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991.

It is used for:

- Web development (server-side)
- Software development
- Mathematics
- System scripting

## What can Python do?

- Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
- Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
- Python can connect to database systems and can read and modify files.
- Python can handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
- Python is suitable for rapid prototyping or production-ready software development.

## Why Python?

- Works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
- Has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
- Allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
- Runs on an interpreter system, enabling quick prototyping.
- Supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming styles.

## Good to Know

- The most recent major version is Python 3, which is used in this tutorial.
- Python code can be written in a text editor or in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Thonny, PyCharm, NetBeans, or Eclipse, which are useful for managing larger projects.

## Python Syntax Compared to Other Programming Languages

- Designed for readability, with similarities to the English language and influences from mathematics.
- Uses new lines to complete a command, unlike other languages that use semicolons or parentheses.
- Relies on indentation (whitespace) to define scope (loops, functions, classes), whereas other languages often use curly brackets.

## Example

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
